# Before submitting

* Ensure your PR follows the [External Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/doc/contributions.md).
* Add the link to your `RFC` or `bug` issue below.
* If the issue does not already have approval from a developer: submit the PR as draft.
* Remove the whole "Before submitting" section.

P.S. You can manage the `awaiting-review`, `awaiting-author`, and `WIP` labels yourself, by writing a comment containing one of these labels on its own line.
